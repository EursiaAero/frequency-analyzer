# frequency-analyzer
Qt 6.10 MSVC2022 frequency-analyzer 3D + 2D based on Timur Kristóf project
# 🌊 Audio Visualizer 3D — Qt 6.10

A real-time **audio spectrum visualizer** built with **Qt 6.10 / C++ / QML**, featuring:  
- a dynamic **FFT waterfall spectrum**,  
- synchronized **particle jets reacting to sound**,  
- and a **3D Earth scene** with HDR lighting and atmospheric glow effects.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎵 Audio Analysis
- Real-time audio capture using `QAudioSource`.
- Fast **Radix-2 FFT** transform implemented in C++.
- Frequency band separation (bass, mid, treble).
- Adjustable sensitivity and smoothness.

### 🌈 Waterfall FFT Display
- Smooth rendering via `QQuickPaintedItem`.
- Color spectrum from blue → green → yellow → red.
- Adaptive normalization based on amplitude and sensitivity.
- Settings automatically saved/loaded from JSON.

### 💫 Particle Jet System (QML)
- Dual **polar jets** synchronized with amplitude peaks.
- Dynamic particle size, density, and color based on FFT.
- “Explosive” bursts on bass frequencies.
- Progressive dispersion and natural motion.

### 🌍 3D Earth Scene (QtQuick3D)
- Rotating Earth model (`.mesh`) with realistic lighting.
- HDR environment using `.hdr` skybox.
- **Additive halo and dynamic light color**.
- Camera with perspective projection.

### ⚙️ Built-in Control Panel
Adjustable live parameters:
- Particle size, lifespan, turbulence  
- FFT sensitivity, brightness, and bar count  
- Density, friction, and frequency stretch  
- All values saved persistently via JSON (C++ backend).

## 🧑‍💻 Based on the work of

This project is **inspired and extended from**  
👉 [**Timur Kristóf**](https://github.com/timur) — *“Qt Audio Visualization / Waterfall FFT”*.

The FFT engine and rendering core (`WaterfallItem`) are derived from his elegant open-source implementation,  
adapted for:
- Qt 6.6+ / 6.10 compatibility,  
- 3D integration,  
- and reactive particle jet system.

Special thanks to **Timur Kristóf** for his foundational work 🙏.
